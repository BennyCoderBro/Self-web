# Self-Web Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my **Self-Web Project**! ðŸš€ This platform serves as a personal web development playground where I experiment with new features, frameworks, and design patterns. It is built to showcase my development skills and will continuously evolve as I implement new ideas and functionalities.

## Current Features
```plaintext
- Frontend Framework: Developed using Vue 3 and powered by Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement.
- Styling: Leveraged Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and easy-to-use UI components.
- State Management: Integrated Vuex for managing application states.
- Routing: Utilized Vue Router to handle navigation across pages.
- Deployment: Deployed seamlessly on GitHub Pages with automated workflows.
```

## How It Works
```plaintext
1. Development Environment:
   - Installed dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Configured Vite with a custom `base` URL for GitHub Pages deployment.
2. Bootstrap Integration:
   - Added Bootstrap via CDN for simplicity and ensured compatibility with GitHub Pages.
3. Build and Deployment:
   - Built static assets with `npm run build`.
   - Deployed directly to GitHub Pages using the `deploy` script.
```

## Future Updates
This platform will be regularly updated with:
```plaintext
- New Features: Adding interactive widgets, animations, and reusable UI components.
- Enhancements: Improving performance, accessibility, and SEO optimization.
- Experiments: Testing new technologies, frameworks, and APIs.
```
